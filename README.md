## Abstract:

Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) originate from the mucosal epithelium of the oral cavity, pharynx, or larynx, with contributions from environmental factors and human papillomavirus (HPV) co-infection. While HPV+ HNSCC often responds well to immunotherapy, HPV- cases present challenges due to variable treatment responses. Immune checkpoint inhibition (ICI) has shown promise in recurrent/metastatic disease, but response heterogeneity persists, linked in part to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). To gain insights into the CD8+ T-cell landscape of HPV- HNSCC, we performed multimodal (RNA and TCR) sequencing of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) from treatment-naïve HPV- HNSCC patients. Additionally, cells underwent *ex vivo* TCR-stimulation; which, together enabled tracing of clonal transcriptomic responses. Analysis revealed a subset of CD8+ TILs highly enriched for interferon-stimulated genes (ISG), which were found to be clonally related to a subset of granzyme K (GZMK)-expressing cells. Trajectory inference suggests ISG transition via GZMK cells towards terminal effector states. However, unlike GZMK cells, which rapidly respond to TCR-stimulation adopting an effector-like phenotype, ISG cells are transcriptionally inert to TCR-stimulation. As such, ISG cells may represent a barrier to effective T-cell differentiation within the TME. Although, the functional consequences of ISG cells are poorly understood, we revealed that they possess receptors and ligands enabling cell-cell communication networks with key TME immunomodulators such as dendritic cells. Additionally, ISG cells were found to be a core feature across various tumor entities and were specifically enriched within tumor tissue. Thus, our findings illuminate the complexity of T-cell heterogeneity in HPV- HNSCC and reveal an overlooked population of IFN-stimulated CD8+ TILs. Further exploration of their functional significance may offer insights into therapeutic strategies for HPV- HNSCC and other cancer types.
