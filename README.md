# HNSCC_Descriptive

- Human samples from HNSCC patients
- samples 1 and 2 are unstimulated 
- samples 3 and 4 are stimulated 
- Patients in 1 match patients in 3 and sample 2 pairs with 4
- Cells are HNSCC TILs sorted on Lymphocytes/Live/CD3+/CD4-/CD8+
- Data acquired was transcript expression, ADT (antibody expression), and TCRA & B sequences
- This analysis uses just Transcript and TCR data

# Message to Thomas Watkins
- I have annotated bits of code with @Thomas: please read 
- for all analysis even bash/python could you please save a .txt file with the commands called and upload to repo, best for collaborative working etc and reproducibility

# scTCRseq tasks
- Estimate epitope specificities with vdjdb tools
- GLIPH analysis - note there is now a Gliph V2 algorithm 
- GLIPH visualisation 
- Logo TCR motif generation 

# scRNAseq tasks
- Transcription factor network analysis
- Establish a signature for TypeI-IFN cluster
- Apply TypeI-IFN signature to other TIL datasets and look for presence/absence of these cells across HNSCC and other cancer entities
- Velocity analysis - semi-started this
