## Abstract

**Background:** Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is linked to human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. HPV-positive and HPV-negative HNSCC exhibit distinct molecular and clinical characteristics. Although checkpoint inhibitors have shown efficiency in recurrent/metastatic HNSCC, response variability persists regardless of HPV status. This study aimed to explore the CD8+ T-cell landscape in HPV-negative HNSCC.  

**Methods:** We performed simultaneous single-cell RNA and TCR sequencing of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) from treatment-naïve HPV-negative HNSCC patients. Additionally, cells were stimulated ex vivo, which allowed for the tracking of clonal transcriptomic responses.  

**Results:** Our analysis identified a subset of CD8+ TILs highly enriched for interferon-stimulated genes (ISG). TCR analysis revealed ISG cells are clonally related to a population of granzyme K (GZMK)-expressing cells. However, unlike GZMK cells, which exhibited rapid effector-like phenotypes following stimulation, ISG cells were transcriptionally inert. Additionally, ISG cells showed specific enrichment within tumor and were found across multiple tumor entities.  

**Conclusions:** ISG-enriched CD8+ TILs are a consistent feature of various tumor entities. These cells are poorly understood but possess characteristics which may impact anti-tumor immunity. Understanding the unique properties and functionality of ISG cells could offer innovative treatment approaches to improve patient outcomes in HPV-negative HNSCC and other cancer types.
